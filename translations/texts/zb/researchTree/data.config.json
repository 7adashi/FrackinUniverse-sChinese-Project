Click a research on the displayed to center the view on it. Click again to hide the list.\n\n- The fourth button will center the view on the middle of the tree, or the currently selected research.\n\n- The last button toggles ^orange;low quality mode^reset;. This makes the GUI jump to a position instead of panning to it, or the center button. In addition, dragging/navigating on the the main screen will update only after you release the mouse button. It is best to use the search list with this mode enabled."
