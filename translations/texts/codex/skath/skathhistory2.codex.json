While there was no war, there as certainly a schism of sorts. The latter group broke with tradition and the Council and left."

With a wealth of new resources to explore and new states to test it in, the first golden age of the Skath began. The first radiotransmitters bred untold of excitement. We were social creatures, after all, and someone new to talk to was thrilling as a concept."
