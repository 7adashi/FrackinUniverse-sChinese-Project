      "Chs": "人类最早的记录刻在Tethys山谷的石头上，这个地区一直远离海洋，离内陆很远。日期表明，过去三万年大约是斯卡斯首次成为两栖动物的时间。根据收集的样本，他们的饮食主要以肉类为主。",
      "Eng": "The first records of our kind were carved in stone in the Tethys Valley, in a region that has always been well inland from the seas. Dating suggests thirty thousand years in the past was approximately the time when Skath first became amphibious. Based on the collected samples, they had a primarily meat-based diet."
