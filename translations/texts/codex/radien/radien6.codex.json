      "Eng": "Although the X'i race seems unwilling to divulge their history to organic historians such as us, expeditions into abandoned territory allow us to explore and estimate based on texts left behind. One large abandoned city filled to the brim with mounds of solidified graphite had an unusual journal left behind that appears to mention some"

According to the journal, it used thousands of strawlike tongues to drink the radioactive energy straight out of its prey.\nIt may also be the culprit behind the mounds of solidified graphite. Of course, there is always the possibility that the graphite mounds are fossilized X'i ancestors.
