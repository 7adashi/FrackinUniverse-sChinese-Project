      "Eng": "How the current Matriarch is chosen is completely unknown, as the women would never tell a male such as myself how their most private sisterhood operates. They speak only that she is the Word, and the Guide, and that Her way is the true path. Through She, they are One. So long as ones fealty is sworn to Her the Burrow is safe."

      "Chs": "更具体地说，从她，伟大的女族长，阿瓦曼达拉，道路的女主人... 她的统治被赐予很多名字。女人是唯一被允许谈论她的人，甚至是提到她的人。这样做的男性必须通过称作交锋仪式性的战斗得到净化，一种从刀刃到战士的能量转移。",
      "Eng": "More specifically, from She, the Great Matriarch, Avemnedara, Mistress of the Way...many names are given to She that Rules. The womenfolk are the only ones permitted to speak of her, or even refer to her. Males who do so must be cleansed through ritual combat followed by Conshak, a 'transfer of energy' from blade to warrior."

      "Eng": "We non-Nightar have often wondered why the Heptarch, despite being publically referred to as their leader, has nothing whatsoever to do with territorial disputes, economics, trade or lawmaking...or any true requirements to keep a civiliation going? The Heptarch is, in all actuality, their military leader only. The true political pull among the Nightar comes from the females."
